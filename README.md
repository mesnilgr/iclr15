for the release.  For people just starting, I recommend

Ensemble of Generative and Discriminative Techniques for Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews
============================================================================================

This code reproduces the results of the following paper:

Grégoire Mesnil, Tomas Mikolov, Marc'Aurelio and Yoshua Bengio: Ensemble of Generative and Discriminative Techniques for Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews; Submitted to the workshop track of ICLR 2015. http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5335

To reproduce the results:

```
git clone git@github.com:mesnilgr/iclr15.git
cd iclr15; chmod +x oh_my_go.sh
./oh_my_go.sh
```

This code has been tested on Ubuntu and Fedora. Compilation of word2vec on OSX seems to be an issue.
